# Pentesting-Multitool
## Introduction

Pentesting-Multitool project arises from the need to gather some pentesting tools into one tool. It will be developed using Python3 adding some external libraries as DNSPython, pythonwhois or scapy. 

The main functions of the script is to collect information about the DNS records, domain or other devices.

## Necessary settings before use it

For use pentesting-multitool.py please follow those steps:  

1.- Install python3, the script has been developed using python3.5.2 but I think that python3.x should work correctly, if not, please report it.  
2.- Install the library dnspython-1.15.0, you can download it from the [official website](http://www.dnspython.org/). If you can use the library with another version, please report it.  
3.- Install the library pythonwhois-2.4.3, you can download it from the [offical website](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/whois). If you can use the library with another version, please report it.  
4.- Install the library Shodan, you can download it from the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/achillean/shodan-python). 

Well, now you are ready to use the script, so enjoy it!

## DNS record query

Warning: Not all DNS records are implemented so check on this table what DNS records are available.

| RECORDS | STATUS |
|:-------:|:------:|
|    A    | Active |
|   AAAA  | Active |
|    MX   | Active |
|    NS   | Active |
|   TXT   | Active |
|   SOA   | Active |

* Note: I know that there are a lot of records but I won't test all, also you can check it on the [official documentation](http://www.dnspython.org/docs/1.15.0/) of DNSpython.

## Whois function

The whois function generate a dictionary with the information but I recommend to check de available keys for the domain specified, anyway if the key isn't available the default value is an error message.  

Sometimes the information is hidden so it's possible that you couldn't get the information.

## Shodan search function

The Shodan search function (ssearch) uses the Shodan external library for implements Shodan browser in our script.

The script implements a "simple search"(is simple as you want), for the search query parameters we will put exactly the same that if we were searching using Shodan website but with the filters separated by "-" here is an example of search query: "ip:8.8.8.0/24-ports:22".

## Special greetings

I'd like to thank the [SUGUS (Free Software Group)](https://sugus.eii.us.es/) of the University of Seville, the [IEEE Seville branch](http://sites.ieee.org/sb-us/) and [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/) for their help and support.
