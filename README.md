# Pentesting-Multitool
## Introduction

Pentesting-Multitool project arises from the need to gather some pentesting tools into one tool. It will be developed using Python3 adding some external libraries as DNSPython, pythonwhois or scapy. 

The main functions of the script is to collect information about the DNS records, domain or other devices.

## Necessary settings before use it

For use pentesting-multitool.py please follow those steps:  

1.- Install python3, the script has been developed using python3.5.2 but I think that python3.x should work correctly, if not, please report it.  
2.- Install the library dnspython-1.15.0, you can download it from the [official website](http://www.dnspython.org/). If you can use the library with another version, please report it.  
3.- Install the library pythonwhois-2.4.3, you can download it from the [offical website](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/whois). If you can use the library with another version, please report it.  
4.- Install the library Shodan, you can download it from the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/achillean/shodan-python).  
5.- Install the library scapy for python3, you can download it from the [official website](http://secdev.org/projects/scapy/).  
6.- Install TCPReplay you can download it from the [official website](http://tcpreplay.appneta.com/).  

Well, now you are ready to use the script, so enjoy it!

## DNS record query

Warning: Not all DNS records are implemented so check on this table what DNS records are available.

| RECORDS | STATUS |
|:-------:|:------:|
|    A    | Active |
|   AAAA  | Active |
|    MX   | Active |
|    NS   | Active |
|   TXT   | Active |
|   SOA   | Active |

* Note: I know that there are a lot of records but I won't test all, also you can check it on the [official documentation](http://www.dnspython.org/docs/1.15.0/) of DNSpython.

## Whois function

The whois function generate a dictionary with the information but I recommend to check de available keys for the domain specified, anyway if the key isn't available the default value is an error message.  

Sometimes the information is hidden so it's possible that you couldn't get the information.

## Shodan search function

The Shodan search function (ssearch) uses the Shodan external library for implements Shodan browser in our script.

The script implements a "simple search"(is simple as you want), for the search query parameters we will put exactly the same that if we were searching using Shodan website but with the filters separated by "-" here is an example of search query: "ip:8.8.8.0/24-ports:22".

## Banner grabbing function

The banner grabbing function first create a socket with the specified IP and port, so we can use a list of ports (separated by ":").

Warning: Not all services are implemented so check on this table what service is available.

| SERVICE | STATUS |
|:-------:|:------:|
|   SSH   | ACTIVE |
|   FTP   | ACTIVE |
|   SMTP  | ACTIVE |
| MARIADB | ACTIVE |

* Note: Please, if you use it with other services and it works, report it.

## Flooding using PCAP function

The flooding function have two options. The first mode is the generator mode that creates a PCAP file with a specified amount of packets and name. Those packets have two layers IP and ICMP (Echo request).

For the flood mode, we will send using TCPReplay the list of packets included on the PCAP file in a loop of n iterations. Is recommended to add 200 packets to the file for DOS Attack and 100 packets to generate ms increase but that depends of the network and AP.

## Fuzzing function

The fuzzing function will generate a number of random packets with UDP, TCP or ICMP layer as indicated by the user, n times (number of generations parameter). After sending the packet it will wait for a response one second if there is no response then a default packet will be created. Then all packets will be stored in a PCAP where the first packet is the sent packet and the second one is the response of this packet.  

Also, is obvius that you have to set the target IP because it useless to set it by using Scapy RandIP function.  

## Man-in-the-Middle function

Well, first I want to clarify that it is not a tool designed to attack, it is a tool to check if our network is vulnerable to a mitm scheme attack using ARP Spoofing.  

Using ARP Spoofing we indicate to the router that the victim's IP is in our MAC Address and at the same time we indicate to the victim that the gateway's IP address is in our MAC address so we are intercepting all the traffic between the victim and the router.  

## Special greetings

I'd like to thank the [SUGUS (Free Software Group)](https://sugus.eii.us.es/) of the University of Seville, the [IEEE Seville branch](http://sites.ieee.org/sb-us/) and [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/) for their help and support.
